# ATY - Audio To Youtube

You can upload to youtube only video that's why you should convrert audio to video.

## aty.bat
1) you should have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) in path
2) replace `"D:\development\ffmpeg\mp3.jpg` with path to image that will be in video
3) usage `aty some_audio.mp3`. Will create `some_audio.mp3.mkv` in the same directory
